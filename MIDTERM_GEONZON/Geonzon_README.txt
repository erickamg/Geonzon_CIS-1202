explaining the features and how to use the calculator

The simple calculator is a web-based calculator that contains primary features and functionalities in calculating numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. In my calculator, it has a C button which clears any inputted character. The arrow key deletes the latest character inputted, the * button is for the multiplication, the + is for adding numbers, - is for subtracting, while / is for dividing. Also, the = button is essentially included to display the resulting number when calculating the given numbers, digits from zero to nine, period is used for decimals, and parenthesis are also included. To achieve an intuitive and user-friendly interface, the design is simple and direct to allow easy navigation and comprehension of the users, from its background colors, smooth and effective button transitions and hover, to the simple spacing and design. These are all fundamental in achieving a basic calculator that effectively performs arithmetic operations.
