        <b>Dear Mama, </b><br><br>
        <sup>I hope this message finds you well.</sup> I want to express how thankful I am to have you as my mother. You have given me everything and more than I could ever ask <br>for.
        I am grateful for all your sacrifices, your love, your patience, and care poured to me. I wish that someday I could give you the life you deserve. I hope you are<br>
        doing well on your own. I wish you all the goodness in life. <mark>Thank you and I <strong>love</strong> you!</mark><br><br>
        <strong>Love,<br>
        Ericka</strong>
